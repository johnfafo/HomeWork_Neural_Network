Pleaase find attached Neural_Network homework.

I was able to develop a model using the initial parameters however the accuracy was quite poor .<br> <br>

I was then able to optimize the model by changing the activation function to "sigmoid" and adding one more hiden layer with significantly increased accuracy<br>

For the third model, i changed the activation function to "selu" However this was with reduced accuracy <br>
